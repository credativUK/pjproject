PJProject / PJSip can be found at http://pjsip.org/

This package is currently based on a fork of PJProject that is
maintained by the developers of Asterisk. It adds support for
dynamic linking, which is required to use this library as a separate
package within Debian:

The support for building PJProject as dynamic libraries has been
coordinated with Upstream and should be merged Real Soon Now[tm].
